#Project:Analysis and classification of heart diseases

A project to analyze and classify specific heart diseases based on data from real patients or non-patients, using a traditional machine learning model or using neural networks.
________________________________________
These are the characteristics used to classify diseases based on their quantities:

Chest Pain Type (Chest Pain Type - 4 values)

Indicates the type of pain the patient feels, and is an important indicator of heart disease.
Some symptoms (such as squeezing pain) are associated with heart damage, while other pain may be unrelated.
Blood Pressure at Rest (Resting Blood Pressure)

This is lower than blood pressure when not exercising.
High blood pressure can increase the risk of disease, as it puts an increased load on the heart and arteries.
Serum Cholesterol (Cholesterol in the Blood - mg/dl)

High blood pressure is a major factor in atherosclerosis.
This increases the likelihood of stroke in the blood vessels, which increases the risk of heart attacks.
Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL)

If your fasting blood sugar level is higher than 120 mg/dL, it may be an indication of diabetes.
Diabetes has led to heart disease, which increases the risk of blood vessel damage.
Resting ECG results (Resting ECG results - values ​​0, 1, 2)

Shows any electrical abnormalities in the heart when cold.
Abnormalities may indicate blood flow problems or damage to the heart muscle.
Maximum heart rate achieved (maximum heart rate achieved)

Affects a large number of beats that can reach their maximum during exercise.
Values ​​may indicate heart problems or a decrease in heart rate.
Exercise-induced angina (Exercise-induced angina)

Check if the person experiences breast pain during chest exercises.
If present, it may be a sign that the heart is not receiving enough blood during exercise.
Oldpeak (ST segment elevation during exercise)

Measures the extent of ST segment elevation of the heartbeat during exercise.
Estimates may indicate impaired cardiac perfusion, which could indicate a possible COVID-19 infection.
St segment elevation during exercise (ST segment slope during exercise)

St segment elevation during exercise testing.
As a result, normal may not indicate the effects of cardiac blood flow.
Fluoroscopically colored major vessel count (0-3)

I have had vascular swelling resulting from healing of the blood vessels.
The larger the swelling, the larger the lesion.
Blood flow diagnosis (0 = reversible defect, 1 = obvious defect, 2 = reversible defect)

It shows whether there is significant obstruction of blood flow to the heart muscle.
A fixed defect indicates damage, while a defect in contrast may indicate a well-treatable CD.
Conclusion:
This factor is an essential part of the classification of heart disease, as certain indicators (such as high blood pressure, high blood pressure, maximum heart rate, and limited heart rate) indicate a higher risk of developing heart problems.
